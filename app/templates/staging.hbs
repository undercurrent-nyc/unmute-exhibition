      <span class="bold text-xl leading-tight">un/mute.</span> An
      international group exhibition of collaborative works by 28 artists
      across multiple disciplines, <strong>un/mute</strong> is the
      culmination of two online residencies, 10001 and 10002, launched in 2020
      to provide European and NYC-based artists an opportunity for critical
      exchange and collaboration during the COVID-19 global pandemic. 10001 and
      10002 are video archives of the paired artists' conversations as they
      navigate collaborating with a complete stranger. The project challenged
      teams to
      overcome the limitations of lockdowns as they connected across artistic
      mediums, language, culture, generations and time zones to find new forms
      of expression and meaning within art.
