          blurb: "Mining is about possession. “Mine” as a pronoun denotes possession of a speaker, while in noun or verb format it is defined as the excavation of fossil fuels or minerals from the earth. From two distant geographic locations of China and Estonia, Mo Kong and Olesja Katšanovskaja-Münd find a crossroad in the exploitation and socio-political atrocities that accompany the mining of their homelands. Using an online artificial intelligence program, they processed a collection of their own pictures of landscapes and stones from their native homes. The AI platform mutates and alters the visual images, much like mining impacts our landscape physically, environmentally and socially. In the exhibition, the output is installed as a wallpaper, visually exploiting it again as commodity, reproduction and the sublime. The metamorphosis of that image is video projected onto a rock as part of this installation as well as onto an eco-friendly building in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. The rock is the only concrete and tactile object in this installation, there is no canary signaling our fate, but an abstract algorithm shedding light onto the impact we project onto our planet.",

          blurb: "Composer Mariella Cassar-Cordina and mixed media installation artist Nicola Ginzel explore the physicality of their respective mediums in their artistic practices. <em>Sonos Civitatem MMXX</em> is a collaborative film that brings together Ginzel’s frottage works and Cassar-Cordina’s textured musical language. Frottage is a process of rubbing — an intimate interaction between surface, paper and artist where our sense of touch reports and gives agency to our sight. There is a shared sensuality that emanates from the drawings, the intimate way in which the camera interprets the drawings and the use of the piano as both percussive and string instrument. Just as Cassar-Cordina’s recorded sounds are created in an untraditional pianist manner so are many of Ginzel’s rubbings. Cassar-Cordina uses loose strings to physically rub the stationary piano strings inside the grand piano’s body and includes pre-recorded sounds of Maltese soundscapes and Ginzel’s motivational utterances, while many of Ginzel’s frottages originate from her own technique of hand stitching “everyday ephemera” with thread. These repeated movements of traction, with strings and surfaces, demand our focus and create a meditative stillness within ourselves. The piece is an organic dialogue via Zoom. The artists investigate how to communicate the tactile into the ephemeral and then into a mediated piece that harkens back to the analog and concrete. We decry the “innovations” when the “real” is lost, whether it is a live performance versus a recording, or a vinyl record versus a digital file. This work reminds us that in navigating a “new normal,” some things may be lost but other things are gained.",

In this highly collaborative software piece, Justyna Górowska’s built environments and Ieva Mediodia’s painted visuals combine in a semi-fictional landscape that explores an interconnected ecosystem on all levels — spiritual, mental and physical. The artists discovered through their Zoom conversations that their diverse works intersected in an urgent concern about climate change. Waters from melted glaciers from the poles intermingle across the landscape in Arktikaantarktika. The artists posit that the climate change that we observe in the physical environment is “climate change” within ourselves as well. <em>Arktikaantarktika 0.9</em> is also a meditation on our cognitive dissonance about time — we cannot easily comprehend daily incremental environmental changes, but we can see changes over time; and yet, especially during the pandemic, we repeat the adage that the days are long but the years are short.<br /><br />Please create your own tour at <a href='http://www.arktikaantarktika.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='underline'>www.Arktikaantarktika.com</a>.",

Starting from Luisa Muhr’s video footage of quiet details observed in New York City and Ada Van Hoorebeke’s textiles made with natural dyes, the artists borrow elements of each other’s works and reinterpret them into a collaborative piece, while, in the same breath, they invite other artists viewers to create their own interpretations. Shapes, symbols and words from everyday life are distilled into large sculptures and sound interventions. Van Hoorebeke’s unique hand-made wax stamps used on her resist-dyed fabrics and sculptures meld into Muhr’s sonic and body interpretations, coalescing into a musical notation that can be again reinterpreted by a future contributor. The work questions the codes and heuristics inherent in communication and asks us to embrace, rather than resist, how others might transform our ideas.",

Please touch the hand-made zine that’s before you — it’s the result of the experiments in artistic process undertaken by artists Gabriele Gervickaitė and Yi Hsuan Lai as they observed and recorded their immediate surroundings and built connections through their discussions. In <em>Body and Environment</em>, the artists mix the staticity of photographs, the physicality of typewriters and embroidery, the ephemeral nature of Zoom conversations and the transience of text messages to form a new body that was created in the Cloud and now exists in physical form. This zine acts as the corporeal manifestation of their dialogues — bound by a spine, tattooed with type and sutured together with embroidered elements giving decorative agency and more importantly as stitches mending wounds to be healed. Gervickaitė’s and Lai’s dialogues surround the body, beauty, prosthetics and the physical limitations of our environments. Although the work was created during a global lockdown, when our worlds became very small and our senses were limited to interpreting what was nearby, it explores the possibilities of collaboration and synergy within exogenously-imposed parameters. By recording certain observations over others, and creating both a permanent zine and copies meant for distribution, the artists investigate the permanence of certain ideas, the impermanence of others and the sharing of both. Please touch.  Please take a copy.",

Both commencing from a practice of performance, they explore language’s fickle nature with concepts of disembodiment, potential and the boundary where the two points meet to create concrete objects which intermingle in their installation. Mirroring the lifespan of a tree, Mirutziu takes molds of his own body as a way to measure and record time, growth, age and decay. These forms are suspended over the functional yet physically uncomfortable chairs Shavers has constructed. Their design originates from a found object, shaping new utility and giving multi-purpose to the discarded/invisible. Her chairs are painted to materialize the digital glitch; a green screen and Photoshop’s transparent checkerboard interface. The chair’s utility is visible, but only when an individual sits upon one and experiences the time spent, do we fully recognize our mindfulness and awareness of the self/body. Mirutziu and Shavers’s complementary forces meet in a physical space to meditate on the capacity and limitation of our own time and experience in the corporeal world that we encounter spiritually or virtually; actively or passively.",

Through repeating forms, a lexicon of gestural sequences and a familiar-yet-surprising clarinet composition, the artists explore intimacy and connectivity through video and life-size sculptures that invite the audience into the artists’ private spaces and into recalling the experience of being around others. From the start of their conversations, Neu and Grey understood <em>Miss(ing)</em>  to be a continuous work — as manifested in this installation, at such time the artists can meet in person and into the future.

Their collaboration is a slideshow that shuffles a broken timeline of text and imagery meeting in the year 2013; signaling Aksu’s emigration from Turkey to Germany and Maldonado’s immigration to the digital world with the purchase of an iPhone. The collected imagery reveals and embraces photography’s analog and digital spectrum as a tool for documentation and how the evolution of the medium impacts subject matter. Making the process both magical and temperamental, analog photography uses a roll of film to capture the image. When loading the film into the camera, the beginning of the reel is typically exposed to light, damaging it and making these first snapshots practice images to be discarded. Aksu welcomes these reject shots, giving them new purpose within the carousel. With the advent of the digital camera synonymous with our phones, the preciousness and documentation practice of capturing milestones and celebrations was forever changed. With her first iPhone, Maldonado finds herself consumed with inventorying all moments, non-occasions — giving new value to time and the generic. Their menagerie of analog and digital imagery and word hum a narrative of misfits, non-occasions and immigration, one where we can all relate to — the foreigner in a new home.",

The sculptural works of Aaron Bezzina and Kyle Hittmeier create a space of rehabilitation, seizing humor, duality and time. Ironically, these medieval, war-like sculptures of a double catapult and digitally rendered flags, germinated from conversations about space and post-intimacy. Made from readily available lumber and fasteners, the hand built, primitive catapult opposes another one, where two individuals can sit, face to face — eye to eye, one can also imagine two laptops facing one another. Modeled virtually, the artists chose only to include the animation of the digital flags, waving in the air, acting as identifiers to the projectiles and simultaneously breathing life into the inanimate catapult. A catapult is not a firearm, it does not need gunpowder or other propellants and rather uses potential energy. This physical stored tension parallels the virtual; we launch Zoom meetings hurling ourselves into the virtual/online abyss where much of our identities are swallowed up. The absurdity of launching our physical bodies acts as a Vanitas reminding us of our impending mortality, while appropriately allowing us a much-needed slapstick chuckle when imagining our bodies projecting through infinity.",

An invisible force, sunbeams transcend metaphor and agency for the collaborative work of photographer Sanne De Wilde and multidisciplinary social practitioner H. Lan Thao Lam. Drawing on their personal experiences of living in foreign lands and vocalizing those emotions in their online conversations, inclusion and access become the axis for their site-specific window installations at both venues. With pandemic lockdowns compressing our daily routines into a singular interior space, the windows that face outward from isolation became an integral escape psychologically, visually and emotionally. And even though humanity was confined, the light still had a way in. A quote related to light, language, space and sight punctuates the vinyl installation at the Austrian Cultural Forum New York. The text flanks the entrance as a salutation to the viewer, an invitation to all pedestrians to enter. Across the East River, De Wilde and Lam collage vinyl imagery of water and light upon Undercurrent’s entrance. A gridded doorway provides structure to these amorphous elements and simultaneously reminds us of nature’s order and design. As we pass through each of these window installations we may allow our perspectives to bend, scatter and refract like light, to illuminate our path and bring new sight and understanding to foreign experiences. No matter our proximity or distance from one another we are all connected through nature and its invisible yet ubiquitous structures",

          blurb: "The pandemic obfuscated our public and private environments. Our domestic spaces were redefined, into offices, schools, playgrounds and studios. Saddie Choua and Anna Bera found their studio practices and interests on opposing ends of the spectrum; Choua is a conceptual artist who embraces new media and Bera a functional sculptor working with hand building, craft and design. Overcoming this challenge, they used the recorded footage from their meetings as their material to create a video displayed on a monitor within an installation. Spliced and collaged, their video becomes one of a new conversation, with a new duration, in an attempt to collaborate. How does one find new identity within collaboration? How is creative autonomy impacted with another author? The function of the work is reflexive and echoes back in the gallery’s installation of the private domestic space within the public gallery for display. The video exhibited on a pedestal straddles the living room and the gallery, augmented with drawings and imagery directly related to the video itself. Softening the sacred gallery space with the profane identity of a domestic interior, the video-object and the installation-environment forge from a dialogue between two characters into a singular monologue. The overlapping voices — bodiless, multiplied and disparate are like the same sentence being written over itself, bringing it to a meta level. In <em>Close Up Black</em> the artists ask themselves whether they are playing a role in an experiment. (Un)consciously they considered themselves Actors, fulfilling a function in the residency requiring collaborative work; for Bera and Choua, the medium becomes the message.",

          blurb: "While seemingly having diametrically opposed aesthetics, both Emily Shanahan and Marie Lukáčová primarily work in video and share a common subject of dismantling and dispelling cultural normalcies of the feminine. Shanahan works through a tech-lens exploring artificial intelligence and labor, while Lukáčová embraces cultural movements as a conduit such as mythological folklore and hip hop. After bonding over their interests in ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) videos and the integration of song in their individual practices, they recorded sounds from the interiors of their homes and their neighborhoods. The artists chose to independently exhibit a small set of drawings upon one wall — a meditation on their work finding a smaller footprint in studio practice, medium and installation. The tension and opposition of Shanahan’s minimalist approach and Lukáčová’s maximalist Risograph prints create a discordant harmony. Their imagery eerily stokes reflections from their online residency exchanges, from how small spaces will impact our bodies and minds to our hypnotic compulsion to want to know our own future. Originating from their analogy that quarantine is every individual hibernating in their own cave — upon exiting may we draw connections in a communal light and shared space.",

Although the past 18 months were marked by social isolation, this period was also the height of massive collective action.  Social scientists have observed a paradox that shared isolation is a collective phenomenon, and that new forms of solidarity emerged from the pandemic. The installation is a multi-sensory experience of anxiety, hope and fear in a time of global protest, a global pandemic and global uncertainty — and how the individual both affects and effects (and is affected by) global forces.  While the artists spoke of “mutual dreaming,” the physical manifestation of the artwork includes only elements of the collaboration, thus exploring the limits of communication and questioning whether the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.",
